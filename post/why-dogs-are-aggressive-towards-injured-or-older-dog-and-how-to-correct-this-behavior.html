But have you ever thought about why dogs are aggressive towards each other?<br>It is common practice In humans and also in other animals that strong members of the community take care of the weak ones. But in dogs, it is contrary. Stronge dogs are often seen to attack the weak ones. Can you guess which is the reason behind that?<br>Well, the simple answer to this question is their genetics and their historical background. Yes! The aggressive behavior of the dog is due to their historical evaluation. Since dogs have a compatible genetic makeup with the wolves, so it is thought that the dogs have evolved from the ancestors of the wolves. That's why we see the same aggressive behavior in wolves and dogs. The next component of history that has paid a part in the aggressive behavior of the dog is the evolution and survival conditions. You might have heard the scientific theory of Charles Darwin about the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/survival-of-the-fittest" target="_blank">survival of the fittest.</a></p><p>According to Charles Darwin, the fittest species of the time got the chance to survive, and the fittest species, after getting dominance over other species continue to live. This theory was once applicable on all specie, and all species use to fight for survival including dogs and human, but with time as the things become better, species adapt themselves, now no specie try to get dominance over other for survival, but unfortunately, the behavior hasn't changed much in case of dogs.</p><p>Dogs stills show aggressive behavior towards each other, and they still try to show dominance over each other, and especially over the old, weak, and injured dogs. They thought that they can get dominance over the weak or injured dogs easily. That's why the dog often pounces upon the weak dogs.<br>Along with the intrinsic component of aggressiveness, there are many other reasons that cause aggressiveness in dogs.

Dogs can be possessive over a toy, food, any specific place, their owner, or any other thing. When someone tries to take the specific thing, on which the dog is possessive, they show a violent reaction. The obsession of the dogs over favorite things is so great that sometimes they attack their owner to get that thing. In the same way, dogs attack other dogs when they try to take his/her things.

Sometimes the level of aggression increases so much that the dog becomes unapproachable. So, if your dog is suddenly showing unapproachable aggression, then check for injury or illness, especially in the abdomen or in the intestine area. Diagnosis for any kind of parasite is also recommended. Aggressive behavior of the dog due to illness, injury and depression could be control by adopting good pet practices.<br><strong>Mostly this kind of aggressive behavior goes away after the proper treatment of the ailments. Contrary to this, delay in treatment causes a serious change in the attitude of the dog. In some cases, dogs even become aggressive toward owners.</strong></p><h3 id="dominance">Dominance behavior :</h3><p>As described above, aggression in dogs is to acquire dominance over other dogs is also a common cause of dog aggression. Dogs loved to be in charge of the environment. When they saw another dog, they try to prove their dominance in front of other dogs.<br>That's why when two strange dogs meet, they show aggression in form of barking, snapping, and bitting to get dominance over the other dog. Most pet owners take the dominant aggression lightly, and some even enjoy it at first, but the aggression exacerbates with time and becomes difficult to control. So, <strong>it is important to control the dominance aggression at an early stage.</strong></p><h3 id="illTreatment">Aggression due to ill-treatment:</h3><p>The dog is one of the loyal animals. In exchange for their loyalty and love, dogs demand love and affection from the owners. When owners fail to provide the required affection and time to the dogs, they often become aggressive.<br>The aggressive behavior in a dog is also an exchange of the aggressive behavior of the owner. When owners show aggressive behavior to a dog, then the dog also shows aggressive behavior.<stong>This type of aggression is most common in male dogs.</stong></p></div><div class="articleSection" id="differentiate"><h2>How to differentiate normal and dangerous aggression in a dog?</h2><p>At one level or on another, all the dogs show aggressive behavior.
