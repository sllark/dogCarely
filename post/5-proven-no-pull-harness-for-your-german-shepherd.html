Everything You need to know about a Dog Harness</h2><p>There are several aspects of a Dog Harness that you may need to know to get a complete understanding of why your dog needs a harness? And, how does a harness work?<br>Here is everything that you need to know about a harness:</p><h4 id="dogHarness">1. What is a Dog Harness?</h4><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_harness">dog Harness</a> is equipment made of straps put around the trunk of a dog's body. The harness is used to attach leashes replacing traditional neck collars.<br>In traditional neck collars when a dog pulls the leash, all that pressure goes on the neck of the dog resulting in choking and neck injuries. To fix that problem these days we use a dog harness, a harness distributes the pulling pressure of a dog evenly on the back and upper body whenever he/she pulls the leash, securing the neck of your dog. Moreover, a harness can be used for many different purposes such as teaching your dog not to pull the leash, controlling your dog more safely, and attaching gears to a dog harness.</p><h5 id="types">2. Types of Dog Harnesses:</h5><ul class="circled-list"><br><li>Back Clip Harness</li><li>Front Clip Harness</li><li>no-pull Harness</li><li>Assistance Harness</li><li>Car Safety Harness</li><li>Tactical Harness</li><li>Step-in Harness</li></ul><h4 id="noPullHarness">3. What is no-Pull Dog Harness?</h4><p>A no-pull dog harness is a special type of harness designed in such a way to minimize your dog’s pulling and train him not to pull the leash. This harness is similar to Front Clip Harness as it has a Clip or Ring in front of it to which you can attach the leash. By attaching a leash to the Front ring, whenever your dog tries to pull the leash he gets turned around instead of going forward, discouraging his bad pulling behavior. Moreover, a handle is also provided on top of these Harness to quickly take control of your dog if something gets wrong.<br>So, if your German Shepherd pulls you when you are on a walk or hike, it is a better idea to get one no-pull harness for your German Shepherd to keep your walk a pleasure for both of you.</p><h3 id="howToPick" style="padding-top:6rem;margin-top:0">4. How to Pick the best no-Pull Dog Harness</h3><p>As you can see, there are a lot of harnesses out in the market but how can you find the best harness for your dog?<br>Here are a few points that you can follow to find a perfect harness for your dog according to your requirements and your dog's size:</p><h5>Durability</h5><p>A rule of thumb for buying anything is whether it is durable or not. If anything you are buying is durable then it is worth checking other features and buying it.<br>If the harness is built with quality material and has strong Leash attachment Rings and buckles with great stitching then there is a great chance that the harness would be durable and will last long.<br>One thing to increase the lifespan of the harness is to look for a harness that after putting it on your dog, he/ she won’t be able to chew it. If your dog can chew the harness, chances are it would be destroyed within weeks, even days.</p><h5>Front and Back D-Ring</h5><p>The most important feature of a no-pull harness is Front D-Ring where you can attach a leash. A front D-Ring changes the direction of your dog if he tries to pull the harness letting him know that pulling is not good. In this way, he will soon learn not to pull the leash.<br>The back D-Ring is handy when your dog learned not to pull much then you can attach a leash on the back ring. Your walks would be more enjoyable when you have a leash on the back ring and your dog does not pull a lot.</p><h5>Comfort and breathable</h5><p>If you bought a harness for your dog that is not comfortable for him/her or is not made with breathable material then your dog won’t love wearing the harness. He might get upset after wearing it and try to hide from you whenever he sees you with the harness.<br>It is better for both of you and your dog to have a comfortable harness. It should be:</p><ul class="circled-list"><li>Lightweight</li><li>Remain Cool on hot days</li><li>Water-Resistant</li><li>Easy to get on and off.</li></ul><h5>Adjustable straps</h5><p>Not all dogs have the same body shape and size hence we need some kind of mechanism so that we can adjust the harness to dogs with different body shapes and sizes.<br>To handle the issue of completely fitting the harness to different dogs with different body shapes, harness manufacturers used adjustable straps. You can adjust those adjustable straps to fit it as custom fit on your dog’s body according to his body shape.<br>There are commonly 4 or more adjustable straps in good quality Harness giving you full control of fitting the harness in whatever way you want.</p><h5>Top Handle</h5><p>Generally, there are two leash attachment clips on the harness giving you good control over your dog but there are some situations when you want to grab your dog quickly to avoid bad incidents like dog fights or your dog running after a cat.<br>In those situations, a top handle on a harness comes in very useful and keeps your dog safe. You should look for a harness that has a Top Handle as it is one of the important features of a quality harness.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>After reading the whole article you know why you need to keep your German Shepherd in a harness whenever you're out with your dog.
