Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease and becomes a source of many other harmful to deadly conditions in the host. The sole source of leptospira bacteria is the wild rodents.<br>Dogs become infected with the bacteria when their conjunctiva or mucus membrane gets exposed to the infectious agent. Leptospirosis is most common in dogs. But the good news is that vaccination against leptospirosis is available. But before administering any vaccination in your dogs, it is crucial to know its benefits and side effects. So, in the following article, we will see what are the pros, and cons of the leptospirosis vaccine.</p><p><strong>The leptospirosis vaccine has many benefits. But like all vaccines, the leptospirosis vaccine does not prevent the disease. In fact, it creates a specific number of antibodies that make the disease much milder if infection occurs. There are also several side effects of the leptospirosis vaccine, but in most cases, they are mild. The most common side effects of the leptospirosis vaccine are lethargy, mild fever, and loss of appetite. While the acute side effects of the vaccine include diarrhea, allergy vomiting, and collapse.</strong></p><p>If we see in detail, the leptospirosis vaccine has more benefits or pros than cons. Before discussing the pros and cons of the leptospirosis vaccine, let's discuss a bit about leptospirosis infection in dogs. It will help us to better understand how crucial the leptospirosis vaccine is?

What is Leptospirosis in dogs?</h2><p>Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. It affects animals and humans. Bacteria of the genus leptospira cause the disease. Leptospirosis causes a wide range of symptoms in dogs and all the other hosts.</p><p>Leptospirosis spread through the urine of infected animals. The urine of the infected animal stays in the water and soil and can survive there for a long time. Different kinds of domestic and wild animals carry the leptospira genus. But wild species, specifically the raccoons, are the most important carriers of the infection.</p><picture><source data-srcset="../img/webp/dog-in-contiminated-water-inner.webp" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="../img/dog-in-contiminated-water-inner.jpg" type="image/jpg"><img alt="dog in contiminated water" class="lazy" data-src="../img/dog-in-contiminated-water-inner.jpg"></picture><p>You must be wondering why we specifically paying a head-on on leptospirosis infection of dogs? As we have <a href="https://www.dogcarely.com/post/can-dogs-die-from-the-leptospirosis-vaccine.html" target="_blank">talked about leptospirosis</a> diseases and vaccines previously, that is because <strong>it is a zoonotic disease, it can spread from your dogs to you</strong>. So, it is crucial to keep an eye on your dog and get your dog vaccinated against leptospirosis infection.</p><p><strong>Another substantial thing about leptospirosis infection is that it might be non-symptomatic in dogs, but it can cause severe disease in humans.</strong> Leptospirosis infection can even cause acute ailments in humans. So the vaccine is the best solution to avoid this tantrum.</p><p>If leptospirosis infection continues to proceed in the body without medication and vaccine, it can lead to meningitis, kidney infection, liver failure, respiratory distress, and can even cause death.<br>Now let's discuss the vaccine for leptospirosis.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="leptospirosisVaccine"><h2>2. Leptospirosis Vaccine</h2><p>Although leptospirosis could be a deadly disease, you can prevent it by the vaccine. Vaccine against leptospirosis is available around the globe, and it is doing very well in immunizing dogs.</p><p>So do consider administering the leptospirosis vaccine to your four-footed friend. <strong>American Animal Hospital Association has regarded the leptospirosis vaccine as the <a href="https://www.aaha.org/aaha-guidelines/vaccination-canine-configuration/vaccination-recommendations-for-general-practice/" target="_blank">non-core vaccine</a>. Non-core vaccines mean you should vaccinate your pet against bacteria if there is a chance of <a href="https://vetchick.com/2015/09/lepto-vaccine/" target="_blank">exposure to bacteria.</a></strong></p><p>Once administered, the leptospirosis vaccine can't guarantee lifetime immunization against the leptospira genus. Instead, booster shots are administered to ensure long-lasting immunity. Also, we have described that the current leptospirosis vaccine is not effective against all spores of the bacteria. <strong>The current vaccine of leptospirosis is only effective against 6-7 spores of leptospira. And these 6-7 spores are the most deadly.</strong> All other spores of the leptospira are either non-diseases causing or cause only a mild illness in dogs.</p><p>It was all that you need to know about the leptospira and leptospirosis vaccine.
