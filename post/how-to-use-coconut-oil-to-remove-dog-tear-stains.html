Now the question arises why the dogs have frequent eye discharge? The continuous eye discharge could be due to frequent irritation of the eyes, or more often it is due to the improper draining of tears.</p><p>The eyes of the dog have a small hole called puncta. Puncta are present on the summit of the eyelid. The puncta drain the tears in the throat. If there is any abnormality in the draining process of puncta, it will develop a condition called epiphora (excessive lacrimal discharge) in epiphora, there is improper draining of the tears. Epiphora develops as a result of continuous eye infection, inflammation, and irritation. Excessive lacrimal discharge could also be due to long term medication, improper diet, and allergy.<br>Now you must be thinking, how can tears turn white fur into dark brown? Well, there are two main reasons for this:</p><ul class="circled-list"><li>First, the body fluids of dog-like tear, urine, and saliva contain a compound Porphyrin. Porphyrin is rich in iron. When iron-rich porphyrin got the exposure to air, it turns the fur into reddish-brown, the same as the rusting process.</li><li>Second, when the area around the eyes remains wet continuously, it attracts more bacteria and other microorganisms that accumulate in the wet area and start to develop dark rusty spots.</li></ul></div><div class="articleSection" id="prevent"><h2>4.
