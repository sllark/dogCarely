Why Chewing bones cause gums bleeding in dogs?</h2><p>Like human babies, pups are also born without teeth. Dog's deciduous teeth start to appear at 3 to 5 weeks of age. Dogs have 28 deciduous teeth and 42 permanent teeth. At around 4 to 5 months of age dog's permanent teeth start to erupt, and by 7 months of age, all permanent teeth are present.</p><p>You all know that bones are a treat for dogs. <strong>Dogs love to eat bones and Oftentimes they overdo it. These bones, when stuck at the gums, cause bleeding and trauma.</strong> Most dogs’ gums bleed while permanent teeth are developing. Because the gingiva is soft, and the chewed bones get entry into the internal structure of the teeth easily.<br><strong>Once a sharp edge bone gets a chance to enter the gum of a dog, it will lacerate the arteries and veins with its sharp edge.</strong> In most cases, a stuck bone remains at the gingiva for a long period, because dogs can't use their fingers properly as humans to get rid of the stuck bones. The conditions worsen when sharp-edged bones stay there for a long time, causing excessive bleeding. Sometimes the bleeding turns into inflammation and ends up causing gingivitis.<br>The continuous bleeding also causes the build-up of microorganisms. This microorganism causes the dog's mouth to smell bad, and in severe cases, it can also cause tooth decay in dogs.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="diagnose"><h2>2.

The internal bleeding is even worse because it can deteriorate the whole tooth, and the inflammation can spread. Unfortunately, internal bleeding is tough to examine. So if your dog is showing the above signs of pain, but you haven't found any external signs of bleeding, then visit the veterinarian. The veterinarian will conduct a CT scan or X-ray to check the internal bleeding of teeth.</p><p>Dogs are more prone to gums bleeding from 4 weeks to 5 months of age because at this age, teeth are soft and developing. So, if you are offering a bony diet to your dog at an early age, then check the mouth of your pup often to see if there is any bleeding.</p><p>Now let's see, what are the most common symptoms of gums bleeding in the dog.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="symptoms"><h2>3.
