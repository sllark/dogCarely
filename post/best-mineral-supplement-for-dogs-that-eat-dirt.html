Why are Mineral Supplements Crucial for Dogs?</h2><p>Mineral supplements are important for dogs, for maintaining the normal functioning of the body. As we have described above; there are two basic types of <a href="https://www.greatpetcare.com/dog-nutrition/vitamins-and-minerals-for-dogs/" target="_blank">minerals</a>, “macro-mineral” and “micro or trace minerals.” The deficiency of macro-minerals urges dogs to lick or eat soil, it also causes many diseases in dogs. The deficiency of micro-minerals also causes several diseases in dogs, but it is less severe.</p><p>Dogs need minerals in all stages of their life. However, in some stages, it becomes crucial to provide them with mineral supplements so they can maintain a healthy life. For example, during pregnancy and while a dog's permanent teeth are erupting, the mineral requirements increase tremendously.</p><p>Let’s see what functions different minerals perform in the body. To better understand the importance of minerals for dogs' health.</p><h3>1. Macro-Minerals</h3><h4>Calcium</h4><p>Calcium is important for developing bones and teeth. Calcium also helps maintain the normal rhythm of the heart. An ample amount of calcium is required during the growing age and the pregnancy. Pregnant bitches are often found calcium deficient. That's why a considerable percentage of bitches eat soil during pregnancy.</p><h4>Copper</h4><p>Copper converts iron to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is crucial for respiration. Its deficiency can cause anemia.</p><h4>Phosphorus</h4><p>Phosphorus is also important, for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.</p><h4>Magnesium</h4><p>Magnesium is an important mineral. Magnesium boosts up almost 300 enzymatic reactions of the body in dogs. It also helps regulate the normal functioning of muscles and nerves.</p><h4>Sodium chloride</h4><p>Sodium chloride maintains the balance of fluids in the body.</p><p>By seeing the functions of macro-minerals, you can evaluate the conditions or ailments; their deficiency can cause.<br>Now let's see the functions of micro-minerals:</p><h3>2. Micro-Minerals</h3><h4>Selenium</h4><p>Selenium plays a vital role in the metabolism of the body, and it is required for the normal functioning of thyroid glands.</p><h4>Copper</h4><p>Copper has multiple functions in the body. Copper helps the body make red blood cells. It also maintains the immune system of the body. Copper helps transmit nerves throughout the body.</p><h4>Zinc</h4><p>Zinc is required by the defensive cells of a dog's body to work properly.</p><h4>Sulphur</h4><p>Sulphur is crucial, and it makes protein for the normal functioning of the body.</p><p>All other trace minerals also play vital roles in the body. In a nutshell, minerals are important components of a dog's diet. So it is important to provide dogs with a balanced diet having a good quantity of minerals.</p><p>We cannot say anything with certainty about the specific quantity of minerals required by dogs, because the requirements vary with age, breed, sex, physiological status, daily activities exercise, and weather conditions. So it is always smart to choose a dog food that can fulfill the mineral requirements of a dog.</p><p>If you prepare food for your dog at home, then you should provide mineral supplements to your dog, as homemade food can only fulfill the mineral requirements to a certain level. You can add mineral supplements to your dog's diet to make it more nutritious.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="fulfilMinerals"><h2>3. How to fulfill mineral requirements through food?</h2><p>All the supplements mentioned above are best to fulfill the mineral requirements. However, in case you don't want to use any of them, or if using those mineral supplements is not economical for you, then you can provide both macro and micro nutrients to your dog through the food. Let's see <a href="https://thebark.com/content/important-vitamins-and-minerals-your-dog" target="_blank">different food components</a> that can fulfill the mineral requirement of your dog.</p><picture><source data-srcset="../img/webp/dog-nutritious-food-inner.webp" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="../img/dog-nutritious-food-inner.jpg" type="image/jpg"><img alt="dog eating dirt from broken flower pot" class="lazy" data-src="../img/dog-nutritious-food-inner.png"></picture><p>As we all know that; chicken bones are one of the most favorite foods for dogs. Besides being the favorite treat, chicken bones have several health benefits for dogs. <strong>Chicken's neck, wings, and feet are a rich source of calcium and phosphorus.</strong> So if you think your dog is deficient in either calcium or phosphorus, then you should offer your dog chicken's bones. During the pregnancy of your four-footed friend, you should offer chicken bone-based food twice a week to fulfill her dirty requirement and save her from <a href="https://www.dogcarely.com/post/how-to-help-my-dog-with-milk-fever-aka-eclampsia.html" target="_blank">milk fever</a>.</p><p><strong>Fruits, vegetables, and milk have an ample quantity of phosphorus, sodium, and chloride. While red meat is rich in zinc, iron, chromium, and sulfur.</strong></p><p><strong>Whole grains are rich in manganese, copper, and magnesium. </strong>So, you can easily choose which food will satisfy the mineral requirement of your four-footed friends (after keeping their physiological status under consideration).</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="dogEatDirt"><h2>4. Why does my dog eat dirt?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophagia" target="_blank">Geophagia</a> is a common condition in humans and animals. A geophagic animal likes to eat or lick dirt. Geophagia in animals develops when they are anemic, facing digestive issues, or going through nutrient deficiency (more specifically, <a href="https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/5-trace-minerals-your-dog-needs-in-his-diet/" target="_blank">mineral deficiency</a>).</p><picture><source data-srcset="../img/webp/dog-eat-dirt-and-grass-inner.webp" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="../img/dog-eat-dirt-and-grass-inner.jpg" type="image/jpg"><img alt="dog eat dirt and grass" class="lazy" data-src="../img/dog-eat-dirt-and-grass-inner.png"></picture><p><strong>When a diet fails to provide the required minerals to dogs, they become mineral deficient.</strong> So in a mineral deficient dog, the body functions including digestion are compromised. Mineral deficient dogs crave a mineral-rich diet. Dirt is rich in minerals and contains some bacteria. It also helps dogs digest their food.</p><p><strong>Mineral deficient dogs lick the soil because they can smell the presence of high content of minerals in the soil. </strong>Soil satisfies their craving for minerals, and also bacteria present in the soil help them carry out a normal process of digestion. That's why mineral deficient dogs love to eat soil.</p><p>A question that might cross your mind is that if eating dirt helps to fulfill mineral requirements and digestion, then why are we trying to stop dogs from eating dirt?</p><p>Well, yes! <strong>Soil is rich in minerals. But, the soil also contains several other microbes in the soil.</strong> These microbes can cause mild to severe diseases in dogs. Some deadly microbes are also present in the soil (anthrax, fungal spore).</p><p>Moreover, <strong>eating dirt can cause various diseases in the oral and buccal cavity.</strong> So, it is critical to stop the dog from eating the dirt, as soon as possible for their benefit. Let's see in detail, what are the harmful effects of eating dirt in a dog's body?</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="eatingDirtDanger"><h2>5. Why is eating dirt dangerous for a dog?</h2><p>Eating dirt could be dangerous for dogs because it can cause several <a href="https://www.hillspet.com/dog-care/behavior-appearance/why-do-dogs-eat-dirt" target="_blank">life-threatening conditions</a>:</p><ul class="circled-list"><li>Excessive dirt-eating can choke a dog's intestine; 'choke' could be dangerous in severe cases. Surgery may be required to alleviate this condition.</li><li>Soil is a rich source of harmful microbes and parasites. These microbes and parasites can cause numerous mild to severe diseases in dogs.</li><li>Eating dirt can significantly affect the oral cavity.

So, it is important to discourage this behavior in dogs.</p></div><div class="articleSection"><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Dog's dietary nutrients vary according to their age and health status. If your dog has suddenly started eating dirt, then it is because the dog's traditional diet is not providing the required minerals to them.
