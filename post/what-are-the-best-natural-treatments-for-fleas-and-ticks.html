What is vacuuming for fleas?</h3><p>Vacuuming is one of the most effective weapons against fleas. It destroys fleas in all stages of life. Vacuuming your home regularly removes 96% of the eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults from your home. Vacuuming also stimulates fleas to emerge sooner from their insecticide-resistant cocoons, thus hastening their exposure to treatments.</p><picture><source data-srcset="../img/webp/vacuuming.webp" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="../img/vacuuming.jpg" type="image/jpg"><img alt="Frontline Plus image" class="lazy" data-src="../img/vacuuming.jpg"></picture><p>Before starting vacuuming, pick up all the stray items like clothes, toys, shoes, boxes, papers, etc. from all the carpet areas of your home. Clear your home from any pets be it dogs, cats, or any bird. Vacuum the carpet areas of your home thoroughly, especially the areas where your pet sleeps or spends a lot of time. If you are unsure of their sleeping area, look for areas that accumulate a lot of pet hair.<br>After vacuuming the carpets and rugs, turn to hardwood floors, linoleum, and tiles. Then, vacuum furniture, upholstery, cabinets, cushions, pillows, and even your bed. Vacuum under beds and any other furniture. Use corner attachments for baseboards, heat vents, floor cracks, carpet edges, and room corners. If you have a disposable vacuum bag, seal it tightly, and throw it out safely.<br>Instead of just killing fleas, the vacuuming will address the much bigger problem that is the eggs. Getting rid of only fleas is useless because your house will be invaded again in sometime when the eggs of the fleas turn into adults. Vacuuming also eliminates blood and feces, thus removing the food source of fleas.</p><p>There is another method named <strong>“Flea bombing”</strong> in the market to kill fleas indoors, you may have heard of this method. Let’s see if this method works and is it safe for your dog.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="fleaBombing"><h3>9. Does Flea bombing work and is it safe for your dog?</h3><p>Flea bombs are one of the most advertised indoor flea treatments. They are designed to be left alone to release pesticides into the room and kill the fleas. Flea bombs are similar to cockroach bombs and are also known as foggers.<br>Flea bombs work by pressing a button on an aerosol can and letting a pesticide infused fog cover the space. This fog falls on the ground and sticks to the surface. All fleas would be killed that will directly come in contact with the fog and chemicals released from the ‘bomb’.<br>These pesticides are known to kill fleas. But the pesticides are dangerous for your pets. They can contaminate your pet’s belongings. Even if you remove all the toys, beds, etc. of your dogs or cover them with sheets they still pose health hazards.<br>Flea bombs can not penetrate the carpets or other fibers where flea eggs and larvae are mostly present. Their chemical often does not reach hidden or sheltered areas, such as the spaces beneath furniture or the interiors of closets or cabinets. These spaces can often be a habitat for fleas. Fleas in these areas are unaffected by flea bombs. They are also ineffective in case of outdoor or animal infestation. So, it is a dangerous and ultimately ineffective method of flea control.</p><p>By now you know how to get rid of fleas and ticks from your dog and your home using natural remedies and cleaning.
