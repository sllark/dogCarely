Everything You need to know about a Dog Feeder</h2><p>There are several aspects of an automatic dog feeder that you may need to know to get a complete understanding of which feeder you need to get and which suites your situation?<br>Here is everything that you need to know about a feeder:</p><h4 id="whatAutoFeeder">What is an automatic dog feeder?</h4><p>An automatic dog feeder is a programmable food dispenser that can help dog parents feed your dog automatically when they are away or too busy to feed your dog. Automatic feeders help the owners to set multiple meal times and alter the meal portions so that their dogs get the correct quantity of meal at the right time. They keep the food hygienic, clean, and fresh. They also help to schedule your dog’s meals so that aggressive eaters do not overeat and gain unnecessary weight.</p><h3 id="howToPick" style="padding-top:6rem;margin-top:0">Things to look for in a dog feeder</h3><p>When buying a dog feeder, there are many factors to consider. Here are a few points that you can follow to find a perfect feeder for your dog according to your requirements and your dog's size:</p><h5>Automatic feeders</h5><p>They are a great option for dogs that are aggressive eaters. They are made of plastic and have obstacles in the center. The obstacles make it difficult to access food. This slows down the speed of eating. This helps prevent choking, gastric and intestinal disorders, vomiting, bloating, and weight gain.</p><h5>Plastic dog feeders</h5><p>These are typical dishes or containers that are sold in pet stores. It is usually not recommended because animals can develop plastic allergies.</p><h5>High feeders</h5><p>The dog feeders that you can adjust according to the height of your dog are called high feeders. This prevents the dog from applying extensive effort to eat. They improve the body posture and comfort of the dogs. They make swallowing easy. They also help to slow down aggressive eaters. They are a great option for dogs with arthritis, neck, or back problems.</p><h5>Programming</h5><p>Firstly, machine programming is something to consider. To ensure efficiency, ensure that the feeder is easily programmable. The simpler the instructions, the better it is. If you need to check the user manual redundantly due to complicated instruction it is better to go for any other feeder.</p><h5>Portion Size</h5><p>Think about whether the portion size that the feeder is capable of releasing is appropriate for your dog. For example, some machines only release large quantities of food at a time. So, it is inappropriate for dogs that are on diet restrictions. Some feeders dispense food in small quantities which is not suitable for bigger dogs. Thus, you need to look for feeders that dispense portion sizes that are appropriate for your dog.</p><h5>Number of Meals per day</h5><p>The number of times a feeder will dispense food in a day is an important consideration. Most, automatic feeders are capable of releasing food at least two times a day. If you want to feed your dog more you will have to look for feeders that can dispense food more times a day.</p><h5>Holding Capacity of food</h5><p>The amount of food that the feeder can hold is also an important consideration. In case of a large dog having a large appetite, you need to look for a feeder with an adequate capacity for food storage. Otherwise, you will be in the hassle of refilling it again and again.</p><h5>Quality</h5><p>Just like every machine, you need something that is made with quality. Look for a feeder with a sturdy design as you don’t want your pet to tip them over, nudge them, or release more food than the quantity programmed.</p><h5>Pet-Proof</h5><p>The dog feeder needs to be pet-proof. You want a feeder that your dog can not break and eat more than the scheduled quantity. They should also be easy to clean and environment friendly.</p><h5>Power Source and Batteries</h5><p>You should also think about the power source for automatic dog feeders. Batteries power some while others are powered by electricity. The benefit of having an automatic dog feeder powered by batteries is the portability. You can place the feeder anywhere. But they won’t feed your dog if the batteries go dead. So, if you are away for long, they are not reliable. In this regard, electrically powered dog feeders are far more reliable. However, they limit the portability as you have to place them near electrical outlets.</p><h3 id="benifits">3.

How often should a dog be fed?</h3><p>Among the most asked questions by new dog owners is; How often should dogs eat? Generally, you should feed your dog twice a day. The frequency of feeding the dog is less important than the meal portion size. Breed, age, size, and energy levels are the factors that contribute to determining the meal portion size of a dog. The health of the dog also plays a part in determining the meal portion size and frequency of feeding.</p><h5>Labrador</h5><p>Healthy Labradors under 3 months of age should be fed small portions of food 4 times a day. For 3 to 6 months old, feed them 3 times a day. For labradors that are older than 6 months, you can feed them twice a day.</p><h5>Golden Retriever</h5><p>Golden Retrievers under 6 months should be fed 3 times a day. Above the age of 6 months, they should be fed twice a day.</p><h5>German Shepherd</h5><p>German Shepherds should be fed 3 times a day under the age of 12 months. Older German Shepherd should be fed twice a day.</p><h5>Bulldogs</h5><p>Bulldogs under 3 months of age should be fed four times a day. From 3 to 6 months of age, they should be fed 3 times a day. Older Bulldogs can be fed once or twice a day.</p><h5>Beagle</h5><p>From eight weeks to six months beagles should be fed 3 times a day. Older beagles can be fed once or twice per day.</p><h5>Poodle</h5><p>Poodle puppies under 6 months of age should be fed 4-5 times per day while older poodles should be fed 2-3 times a day.</p></div><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>An automatic dog feeder can be very helpful for you if you are a busy person or going away from home for a while.
