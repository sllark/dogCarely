        Is pea protein good for dogs?
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Dogs are omnivorous and they can take protein both from plants and animals. The protein from peas is a plant-based protein and plant-based protein lacks amino acids needed by the dog's body but these amino acids are generally fulfilled by other ingredients found in your dog's food.      </p>
      
      <p>
        So there is no harm to your dog from pea’s protein as long as he/she is having other things to eat. Black eyed peas have a relatively large amount of protein in them as compared to other food ingredients that are good for your dog's health. Hence, pea’s protein is good for dogs but it should not be replaced with meat at all.
