Canine Eclampsia is a postPartum condition. In this condition, the calcium reserves of a dog`s body reduce below a certain level, which causes severe weakness. Although Milk Aclasia can affect dogs of every breed and every size, the condition is more prevalent in the small breeds like; Chihuahuas, English setter, Miniature, and Pinschers. In dogs, this condition is mostly seen after the <a href="https://blog.animalemergencyservice.com.au/milk-fever-in-dogs" target="_blank">4-8 weeks of delivery</a>. But, this condition can also prevail in the last week of pregnancy.<br>The condition usually develops in lactating females. During lactation, milk carries the calcium from mother to puppies. This process causes calcium deficiency in dogs. Usually, the calcium reserves of the dog`s body are enough to avoid the condition. But, an inappropriate diet, during the period of pregnancy and after whelping, and a large litter of hungry puppies, causes the calcium reserve of the mother's body to deplete, and hence milk fever occurs in dogs.</p><p>In milk fever, a large amount of calcium is drained from the dog`s body into puppies through the milk. By the time the calcium reserves of the dog`s body reduce, the dog then begins to draw calcium from her bones. The continuous loss of calcium causes the calcium level of the dog's body to drop below the life-threatening level.<br>Milk fever is a serious condition. As a pet owner, if you feel like your nursing pet is developing milk fever. Then seek veterinary help as soon as possible to avoid any disaster.</p><p>Appropriate calcium is required in the lactating female to perform normal muscular activities. A low level of calcium causes hyperexcitability of muscles. Hyper-excitability is a common sign of milk fever.</p></div><div class="articleSection" id="causes"><h2>What Causes Milk Fever in dogs?</h2><picture><source data-srcset="../img/webp/weak-dog-wirh-milk-fever-inner.webp" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="../img/weak-dog-wirh-milk-fever-inner.jpg" type="image/jpg"><img alt="dog with tear Stains" class="lazy" data-src="../img/weak-dog-wirh-milk-fever-inner.jpg"></picture><p>To avoid milk fever in your pet it is essential to understand how it develops. Following are the root causes of milk fever:</p><ul class="circled-list"><li>During pregnancy, the demand for calcium increases. Calcium is required for the successful development of the fetal bones. Calcium is also required for the successful development of the lactation process. A lot of calcium is required to meet the needs of these systems. The body is not able to generate that high level of calcium. If the mother dog does not get the required level of calcium through the diet, she develops milk fever.</li><li>Parathyroid gland dysfunction can interfere with the disruption of the normal calcium and can cause milk fever.</li><li>Milk production requires a lot of energy, as milk contains a good percentage of calcium, so, during the lactation, the dog's calcium reserves moved to the puppies with the milk. Usually, Mother dogs compensate for the daily loss of calcium by a specialized system. But, if the dog got a large litter, the demand for milk increases. The body`s reserve becomes inadequate, then the body starts consuming the calcium reserves of bones that causes severe muscular weakness, and in the end, it causes milk fever.</li></ul></div><div class="articleSection" id="signs"><h2>What are the Signs of Milk Fever?</h2><p>Every pet owner needs to know, what are the possible signs of milk fever?
